						<p>
            Hopefully by now you’ve actually read <a href="how-i-learned-every-mcat-class-in-six-months.html"  target=”_blank”>how I learned every MCAT class in 6 months</a> before the exam, the time frame
            is relevant here. At the conclusion of the MCAT I actually had gotten hired as a
            medical scribe at what was called Elite Medical Scribes, now owned by Scribe
            America. This was consequently the same time I was hired as an MCAT teacher. But
            here is the unique thing about that... I hadn’t taken a chemistry, bio (except
            HS bio), psychology, etc. class before that point... So how did I do it? How did
            I convince the recruitment staff that I am apt for this intense bio-oriented
            job? That’s what I’m about to share with you. All jobs require one thing, the
            assurance that you can actually get the job done. That’s it... nothing else
            (aside from requirements such as a degree in some cases). So I played off this
            card and you can too. There are many opportunities for medical experience:
            shadowing, lab tech, CNA, volunteer, researcher dealing with patients, niche
            areas, and medical scribing. I would like to pay attention to the very last one
            because it is the only one that you basically get to be a doctor, and get paid for it (usually cheap, but upwards of
            $20/hr if you have full time availability at a private practice). For this
            reason I will focus on medical scribing, this should be your main medical
            experience focus. Shadowing has plenty of forums to help you out as the next
            most valuable pre-med medical experience. My goal here is to tell you what you
            need to know to become a medical scribe, as well as learn nuances and tricks
            that others don’t tell you about how to get in. First, you need a resume that
            states you can get the job done, and more importantly you need a cover letter to
            show it.
            <div> That means you must show you can excel in: </div>
            <div> 1. High pace learning environments </div>
            <div> 2. Environments of high stress </div>
            <div> 3. Following directions from stressed individuals</div>
            <div> 4. Keeping up in high pace environments under pressure</div>
            <div> 5. Having an incredible lust to learn in medicine.</div>
            <p> 6. Is that you can type... (but this is a given. If you can’t, get a keyboard cover, never look at your keys
              again, use this for 3 months, and boom you’ll type like a boss).</p>  

            <p>Scribing has an enormous learning curve, expect to need to learn 1000 medically related words in
              the 4-6 weeks of learning modules (unpaid) which you will watch before becoming
              a medical scribe. The greatest supply of scribe jobs in America comes from
              Scribe America I believe which would have a roughly 4-6 week training course.
              After writing your resume and cover letter (emphasizing all these key skills,
              ideally shown through examples), make sure you follow up (phone preferred) every
              week until you receive the job or get a rejection. When you speak on the phone,
              have those items that you put on your cover letter mentally on hand. Also be
              prepared to answer a couple questions (most popular that aren’t just simple
              interview questions) when you get a phone interview: </p>

              <div> 1. How do you deal with stressful situations? </div>
              <p>I recommend using an answer similar to mine here, I claim
                that I use problem-focused coping. This is actually an MCAT psychology term, it
                means when a problem arises you have a need to solve it as a mechanism of coping. However there are unsolvable
                problems, here is a time where you say what you do to cope, this could be a
                walk, eat, take a second to breath, etc., just make sure it is in the context of
                something you can do in a hospital. </p>
            <div> 2. How do you react when patients are extremely stressed or a traumatic experience has just occured?</div><p>
               Note that you will likely not be able to conversate with patients much, so be able to think
              ahead and say “In such an experience, if my job warrants me the ability to
              respond to the patients, I would...” Here note that you will remain calm because
              calmness in your will have a mirroring and empathetic effect on the patients.
              Acknowledge that you may be asked to leave and will comply, etc. You can’t
              really do much here anyways. </p>
            <div> 3. What will you do if you’re ever not sure how to record something in a chart or begin to fall behind?</div><p>
               You will make sure you get all the essential notes and understand the physician’s reimbursement requires
              that you note all items required for a high level chart (let’s the physician get
              paid more). Also, you understand that some items may be misinterpreted because
              you don’t have the same experience the physician has, you will ask the physician
              if your fellow scribe is unable to help ease your confusion.</p>
              <div>  4. What do you do if you disagree with a treatment regimens the physician has prescribed?</div><p>
                They want to see if you’re someone that will speak up or not. Ironically, it is not
good to speak up here. They want you to know that you are NOT a physician, the
physician is. You will write exactly what the physician tells you. Now you can
say if the regimine looks unusual, you can bring it up asking if that was what
the physician meant to put, this is what you are here for, double checking the
physicians notes and writing the whole interaction down. </p>
<div> 5. What do you do when there is something you don’t know? </div><p>
  Physician time is VALUABLE, and there
indeniably will be words you don’t know. First, look it up. If that is
insufficient, ask a fellow scribe. If that is insufficient, ask another person
in the hospital. Finally, you can ask the physician. Make sure that you show
them you understand the order of command and order of value in time. You’re
there to make the physician's time increase, not reduce. </p>
<div>  6. What is your time commitment for this? </div><p>
  They want 1 year
  of full time or 2 years of part time. But they can’t make you do it, but you
  should want to. In my case I did one year of part time (full time for the first
  3 months). I couldn't stand it anymore because of all the typing to be honest,
  it was giving me tendonitis. Part time is 2-3 shifts a week, each about 8-10
  hours, same as the physicians but you tend to leave a bit earlier than they do.
  Here you need to mention this is the commitment you can provide. They “spend” a
  lot of time training you, so they want to make sure the investment is worth it.
  You will SUCK in the beginning. It’s part of the process, make it your goal to
  learn and get up to speed as quick as possible. Make sure you answer this
  question so they know this.  </p>


  <div>   7. How do you do with large learning curves?  </div><p>
    They want 1 year
    of full time or 2 years of part time. But they can’t make you do it, but you
    should want to. In my case I did one year of part time (full time for the first
    3 months). I couldn't stand it anymore because of all the typing to be honest,
    it was giving me tendonitis. Part time is 2-3 shifts a week, each about 8-10
    hours, same as the physicians but you tend to leave a bit earlier than they do.
    Here you need to mention this is the commitment you can provide. They “spend” a
    lot of time training you, so they want to make sure the investment is worth it.
    You will SUCK in the beginning. It’s part of the process, make it your goal to
    learn and get up to speed as quick as possible. Make sure you answer this
    question so they know this.  </p>


    <p>Your answer will vary, but I want you to hit on a couple points. There are things you
    need to learn: 1. Medical words, 2. Medical notes process, 3. Medical
    reimbursement, 4. Medical software. Form your answers in relation to these. For
    example, I’ve learned many softwares from my unorthodox background, so I worded
    the learning of medical software with this in mind. Same goes for the rest, use
    your concrete examples/experiences to prove you will take this task head on
    because you’ve done it before. </p>

    <p>Remember, they are looking for a great Medical
    Scribe Candidate, so if you can show that you will be good. The way the
    interviews worked for me and tend to work is first, you’ll get some interview
    from a recruiter at the company. If you show that you can meet all those
    criteria I outlined above, you’re good. After, you’ll likely interview in person
    with the head scribe, or do a phone interview first. They know what it takes,
    and they may be pretty harsh. A lot of people want this job, show them you have
    what it takes, and be confident that you do!</p>
     <div> Where do you find these jobs? </div>
    <div>1. Scribe america is the biggest employer of scribes. You will find in glassdoor
    they often treat the scribe like shit. Suck it up, it’s good experience, but
    there are alternatives. They offer the best flexibility schedule wise. </div>
    <div>2. Local postings, this includes craigstlist, or other newspaper postings. Here you can
    find jobs paying 15-20/hr instead of minimum wage. But here it often requires
    that you work normal business hours which you can’t do while in school unless
    you take night classes. </div>
    <div> 3. Ask physician clinics which you know use scribes. Call up and ask, but this is a rudimentary
    approach, thought if it’s all you have then it’s all you have.</div>
    <p>4. Call up hospitals (this is less of a shot in the dark than number 3 and I recommend it).</p>
    <p>So how is this the “Undergrad’s Quickest Path to Medical Experience?” If you
    look at all the other opportunities, aside from shadowing which is super
    difficult to get and is short lasted, this is a tested and true method for
    pre-med students to get medical experience. What I tried to provide is a method
    to get into medical scribing by knowing what they are looking for, making you
    the ideal candidate, even if your experience is lacking. Good luck and happy
    scribing!</p>
