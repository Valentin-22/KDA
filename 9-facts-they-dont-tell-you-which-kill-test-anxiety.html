					<strong>1. 30, 60, 90 Rule</strong>
					<p>
						This is a rule I discovered from working through AAMC materials, and I
						would say the most powerful anxiety reducing rule there is for MCAT
						students. So you’ve probably had questions in test prep material which
						you got wrong, and after you read the answer, you thought, “I still have no
						idea what that means”. This is normal! There are quite a few of these in test
						prep material, I would argue about 3% of test prep company questions
						seem like this.
						Those questions have you going, “I have no idea how anyone could get this
						right”, and if that is the case, you could be spot on; nobody gets those
						right. The reason these questions exist in test prep materials is because
						they boast about having vast arrays of questions, but it also means they
						have some pretty poor questions.
						How is AAMC different? AAMC is a standardized exam, this means they
						need both validity and reliability. Specifically the reliability, the ability to
						have a repeatable test result, even with different versions, doesn’t allow
						questions like these.
						AAMC questions appear to fall into 3 categories: easy, medium, and hard.
						The easy ones 90% of people get them right, the medium ones 60% of
						people get them right, and the hard ones 30% of people get them right.
						This means that if you get a question wrong, you can trust that about 30%
						or more of people got that question right, and if you don’t understand it,
						that just means you don’t understand the topic or misread the question by
						mistake.
						This is good news because the questions you get on AAMC will be honest
						questions which are often (though not 100%) superbly written. So be
						confident that when you get a question on your test prep thinking, “WTF
						does that explanation or question even mean?”, rest easy knowing that
						AAMC will not likely have those questions. I recommend you see AAMCs
						question packs to find out for yourself and not just take my word for it, as I
						don’t represent AAMC..</p>
					<strong>2. Test Prep Company Materials Don’t Fully Represent the Exam</strong>
					<p>Have you taken a full length AAMC exam or done the question packs? If
						not, then you probably won’t know what I’m talking about. When you take
						full length exams from test prep companies you’ll notice a few things.</p>
						
						<p><li>1. Your score is lower.</li>
						<li> 2. There is some questions which are basically super
							explicit facts.</li> 
						<li>3. You’re expected to know things that AAMC will likely
						put into the passage. </li></p>

						<p>Now the score is lower part is described in another section, however let’s
						discuss number 2. The goal of a test prep company is to prepare you. This
						means there material is intentionally difficult (this is a good thing). It
						means they should cover every topic, but they also subsequently cover
						topics you will likely not see. It’s up to you to distinguish the things you
						should and shouldn’t learn from those test prep companies. So that
						plethora of fact-based questions you get on these test prep company
						exams can likely be limited to just the essentials, eliminating a significant
						number of low yield facts.
						Also relating to number 2, the passage length of test prep company
						passages tends to lean toward longer passages as compared to the MCAT
						and possibly more poorly written. This is not true of all companies of
						course, but this makes it more difficult than what you will experience on
						test day.
						I’m sure you’ve gone through some passages (specifically sciences) and
						some of the questions involve a formula you haven’t fully committed to
						memory. Now this is going to happen on the actual exam of course,
						however, there is something to keep in mind. The AAMC exam passages
						are often very well written (in my opinion, of course, and from what I’ve
						seen). This means they have a logical structure. In science passages, the
						logical structure often lends itself to stating the formulas which are
						related to the passage; as such, AAMC often provides the relevant
						formulas more often than do test prep companies. Not that you shouldn’t
						memorize and understand scientific formulas for the AAMC exam, but
						keep in mind memorizing the formulas may not be as important as it tends
						to be for test prep companies.</p>
					<strong>3. Your Test Prep Scores Will Always Be Lower</strong>
					<p>If you’ve taken an AAMC full length and a test prep company full length
						you’ve probably noticed a difference in score and difficulty. Now, if you
						don’t believe me I invite you to look at the link below:
						<ul>
						<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vOMLNFh6G1kSt2Yuclf8VcFJr_k9dwsfPRx5Co-w7lU/edit?usp=sharing"  target=”_blank”>Link to spreadsheet:</a>
						If Spreadsheet link doesn’t work: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mcat/comments/403tb5/score_spreadsheet_now_with_entry_for_the_scored/"  target=”_blank”>Link to Reddit </a>
						</ul>
						What you will find is proof of what was discussed above. The AAMC scores
						tend to be pretty reliable, whereas the test prep scores very dramatically.
						For example, you see score caps on test prep exams that you do not see
						on the actual AAMC exam. Use this to more accurately judge your AAMC
						score position while taking practice exams.</p>
					<strong>4. Your Stamina is Heightened on Test Day</strong>
					<p>Ever have difficulty falling sleep before an exam? Of course! Adrenalin is
						going full force, related to your level of importance you place on that
						exam. Obviously, the MCAT is more important than most of your other
						exams you’ve taken. This makes your adrenaline go, leading to heightened
						awareness (I prefer wakefulness though). You won’t know what I mean by
						taking only practice exams, it needs to be the real thing. When that
						adrenalin (specifically noradrenaline / norepinephrine) rushes your brain,
						it increases your level of attention leading to a hyper focused state that
						benefit your mindset on test day (usually)
						Now some people have issues staying awake for such long bouts of time,
						here are some tips I used. I dressed thin and short - shorts and a tank -
						because it would allow me to stay colder during the exam which protected
						me from falling asleep while reading. I also made sure I knew the best
						foods which worked for me. Personally, I found a pound of fish in the
						morning, and peas with pecans during the exam, tended to keep my
						energy up and avoiding a sugar crash. Additionally, I took 1/3rd of a 5
						hour energy drink during my breaks and recommend it for most of my
						students because coffee or energy drinks are diuretics.</p>
					<strong>5. You Can Retain the Information Much Faster Than You Are</strong>
					<p>
						If you’re anything like the student’s I’ve had, then it’s likely that you have hit
						quite a few plateaus in your scores; this is because of reviewing your exam
						in the proper way and doing better at studying.
						I do have a <a href="5-tips-that-saved-my-students-80-percent-of-study-time.html"  target=”_blank”>5 tips to save yourself 80% of your study time </a> (comparatively of
						course of bad studier vs a good one), but I will hit it briefly here.
						You’re likely moving slow because you don’t know how to study, it should
						only take a day or two to retain 60% of what you’ve studied those 1-2 days.
						This was the number I was able to achieve with myself, and the students
						which performed best tended to hit this number as well. The thing which
						they all had in common was that they knew which study strategy worked
						best for them. This is easier said than done, but I recommend you
						checkout the <a href="5-tips-that-saved-my-students-80-percent-of-study-time.html"  target=”_blank”> 5 tips article.</a>
						So the anxiety reducing fact here (for most but not all students) is that you
						can do much better at studying than you currently are.</p>
						<strong>6. The SDN Forums Lie</strong>
						<div>Ever looked up a question on SDN, and all the responses go like this:</div>
							<div>- PreMedMonkey: Yea I just got 512 on a practice test, so bummed :/</div>
							<div>- DarthDoctor: I tried using that strategy but only ended up with a 508</div>
							<div>- PreMedMonkey: Don’t worry @DarthDoctor, it only took me like 2 weeks to get to 512 from
							that 508.</div>
							<div>-	DrJenkins: @PreMedMonkey @DarthDoctor, those are pretty good! I’ve only hit that 510
							once, all the other time I’m doing research and working as a medical scribe at Harvard
							....</div>
						<div>Yea it’s super irritating. Now, I’m not saying what they are saying isn’t
							true. But I will wholeheartedly say that SDN is a completely unreal
							representation of your competition. Some forum locations tend to be
							rather accurate, however ones revolving around the MCAT tend to be
							extremely biased towards people who willingly admit their scores because
							it’s good. You will notice the same thing in that spreadsheet I had added
							far above. Do not let these unreal representations of the exam stress you,
							SDN must be taken with a grain of salt, you can be in their position (but it
							takes work).</p>
							<strong>7. You’ve Already Done this 10 Times, This Time is No Different</strong>
							<p>You’ll fear doing the MCAT on test day, it’s inevitable, but don’t be blind to
								the fact that you’ve already done it multiple times. I know it sounds like,
								“Well duh, I’ve taken plenty of practice tests”, but think about it. You know
								what was going to happen every test, you know the time you were
								expecting to put in for the day, and hopefully you know how to maintain
								stamina throughout (upwards of 10 times should be your goal). You should
								have already figured out which food works best, which time you should go
								to sleep, which energy method works the best, and have expectations of
								the energy level you’ll feel during each section of the exam (at the
								beginning and end). Don’t let yourself believe that you’ve not experienced
								this countless times, because this will be almost exactly the same.</p>
								<strong>8. Here is How High You Can Probably Go In 3 Months</strong>
								<p>Ever wonder how high of a score you can achieve in the time you have
									before your MCAT? Well it’s always going to very, but from the over 100
									students I’ve had I can give you an idea. The best student I ever had
									started off with a pretty low, but average, score on his first exam (a couple
									points higher than 490). He only had 3 months for his exam (typical) and so
									I told him all the tips and tricks I’m attempting to share with you now. He
									used some of his own, and with his drive and dedication he brought his
									score to just above 515. If you do the math, that’s about 20 points per
									month (pretty substantial!). So an average of almost 7 points a month. He
									was a dedicated student, and many other students got close to what he
									achieved. So if you’ve hit this plateau, this might be a good number to
									keep in mind if you do the study tips in the other article.</p>
									<strong>9. Every First Practice Test is The Worst Exam You’ll Ever See, and</strong>
									<p>
										This relates to the above, but let’s be more specific. Your first exam will
										SUCK! Horrible, pathetic, just quit now while you can you’ll never get into
										medical school... these are the thoughts that go through peoples head
										when they first receive their score. This is completely normal, so don’t
										worry! Your exams will go up, and to make sure they do I highly
										recommend reading the <a href="5-tips-that-saved-my-students-80-percent-of-study-time.html"  target=”_blank”>5 study tips article</a>, it will give you some key
										pointers to getting out of that plateau!</p>
